<h1>🌟 MoodMirror – A Real-Time Mental Health Companion</h1>

  <h2>📖 Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      University students often face stress, anxiety, and emotional burnout without having proper mechanisms to monitor 
      and regulate their mental well-being. Existing tools are usually reactive, impersonal, or lack engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>MoodMirror</strong> is an AI-powered real-time mental health companion that detects emotions through 
      <em>facial expressions, speech tone, and body language</em> and provides personalized wellness feedback. 
      The system is designed to act as a “smart mirror” or desktop/web application that promotes daily self-reflection 
      and emotional awareness for students.
